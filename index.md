# Bio

I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the Nanomaterials Theory Institute (NTI) within the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a Bredesen Center Fellow in Data Science and Engineering at the University of Tennessee. I hold an Master of Science (MS) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington (2019) and a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Mechanical Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune (2016). During Master's I did internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

## Reasearch interest

I specialize in interdisciplinary research that merges theoretical condensed matter physics (computaional physics) with machine learning and artificial
intelligence. My primary focus is on the development and atomistic level understanding of novel ferroelectric materials particularly pervoskites, wurtzites, which are critical for memory,
energy storage, and neuromorphic computing applications. I leverage my expertise in machine learning/artificial intelligence and computaional physics
to analyze complex atomistic events intelligently and enhance the understanding of these materials.
