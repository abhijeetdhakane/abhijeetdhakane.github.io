I am a PhD student in Data Science and Engineering at Bredesen Center for Interdisciplanary Research jointly hosted at University of Tennessee Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I specialize in interdisciplinary research that merges theoretical condensed matter physics (computational physics) with machine learning and artificial intelligence. My primary focus is on the development and atomistic-level understanding of novel ferroelectric materials particularly perovskites, and wurtzites, which are critical for memory, energy storage, and neuromorphic computing applications. Prior to this I was intern at Nano Theory Institute at CNMS-ORNL. I got my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlignton.
